# Amazon Product Recommendation System

This repository contains an Amazon Product Recommendation System built using Python, leveraging collaborative filtering and popularity-based algorithms. The system reads product reviews from a CSV file and processes the data to provide personalized recommendations based on user ratings.

## Project Overview
The Amazon Product Recommendation System provides two types of recommendations:
1. **Popularity-based Recommender**: Recommends products based on their overall popularity (i.e., high ratings or frequent purchases).
2. **Collaborative Filtering Recommender**: Uses user-item interactions to recommend products based on similar user preferences.

The system first loads and processes a dataset of Amazon product reviews, cleans the data, and provides visual insights into product ratings. It then implements and compares both recommendation strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains product reviews from Amazon, stored in a CSV file. It includes features such as:
- `user_id`
- `product_id`
- `rating`
- `timestamp`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amazon-recommendation-system.git
   cd amazon-recommendation-system
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open the notebook `recommendation_system.ipynb` in Jupyter.
   - Follow the steps inside the notebook to run each code block and generate the recommendations.

2. **Load Dataset**:
   The dataset can be loaded from the provided CSV file, which is preprocessed for analysis and modeling.

3. **Analyze and Cleanse Data**:
   The raw data is cleaned using `pandas` to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

4. **Generate Popularity-Based Recommendations**:
   The system calculates product popularity and recommends top-rated products.

5. **Collaborative Filtering-Based Recommendations**:
   Collaborative filtering is implemented using the `Surprise` library with algorithms such as SVD and KNN.

## Algorithms Used

### 1. Popularity-Based Recommender:
   - Products with the highest average rating or most purchases are recommended to all users.

### 2. Collaborative Filtering Recommender:
   - **User-based filtering**: Recommends products that similar users have liked.
   - **Model-based filtering**: Utilizes matrix factorization techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

### Libraries Used:
- **Pandas**: For data analysis and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Surprise**: For implementing collaborative filtering algorithms.
- **Scikit-learn & Scipy**: For additional model building and evaluation.
- **Joblib**: For saving and loading trained models.

## Results
The system outputs recommendations for both approaches:
- **Popularity-Based**: Displays the most popular products in terms of ratings.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Provides personalized recommendations based on similar users' preferences.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - `surprise`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy`
  - `joblib`, `os`, `time`, `math`, `IPython`
